Happening is an open source event/community management tool.

Think Eventbrite meets Meetup, running on your own domain with your own branding.

We're in heavy development and Happening is not recommended for production use. Pull requests are welcomed.

Documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://happening.readthedocs.org).
