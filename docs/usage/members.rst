Members
========

Visitors will be required to register with the website (become a "member") in order to participate in discussions, receive notifications, and register for events. They can do this using an email address and password, or by using one of the support social accounts.

Once they have registered, they will appear in the ``Members`` page of the Staff panel.

**Member Profiles**

Member profile will consist of their name, a biography, and any number of custom profile fields as configured in :ref:`configuration`.

From the ``Members`` page of the Staff panel, you may click on a member's name to view their profile, or click on ``Edit Profile`` alongside their name to edit their profile. You may also click on True/False below ``Staff`` to toggle their staff status (click it when it is True will remove their staff status, clicking when it is False will make them staff).
