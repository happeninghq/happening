Notifications
===============

Notifications are used to inform members when an action occurs which they may wish to be informed about. Some notifications are built into the core of Happening and others are added by plugins.

Notifications can appear in a member's notification feed, be sent to them by email, both, or neither. This is configurable on a notification-by-notification and member-by-member basis.

**Viewing Notifications**

If there are unread notifications, a number will appear in the top bar indicating the number of unread notifications. Clicking on this number will show the latest five notifications, with unread notifications highlighted. All notifications will then be marked as read.

To see all notifications, member's should click on ``See More`` at the bottom of this truncated notification feed.

**Notification Settings**

To access notification settings, members should click ``Notification Settings`` from the :ref:`member_settings` page. On this page, each notification is listed with a title and a description of what the notification does.

Most notifications allow you to configure whether it appears in your notification feed and whether it is sent by email. This can be changed by ticking the appriate checkboxes and clicking ``Save``.

Some notifications only allow you to configure either the notification feed setting or the email setting.
