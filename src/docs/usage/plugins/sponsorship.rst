Sponsorship
=============

The sponsorship allows for displaying of organisations or individuals who support your event/community. It supports two types of sponsor: event sponsors and tiered sponsors, you may use either or both in your commuity.

**Creating/Modifying Sponsors**

To create a sponsor, visit the Sponsors page of the Staff panel. You will be asked to provide:

* Sponsor's name
* URL
* Description, which allows markdown formatting
* Logo

To edit an already created sponsor, visit the Sponsors page of the Staff panel and click on the sponsor's name, then click ``Edit Sponsor``.

**Event Sponsorship**

Event sponsorship is where a sponsor contributes to the running of a single event, but may not be otherwise associated with the wider community. The event sponsor is shown on the event page, the index page when the event is advertised, and in all emails relating to the events they sponsor.

To add an event sponsor, visit the Events page of the Staff panel, then click on the name of the event you wish to add a sponsor for. Then click ``Add Sponsor``.

**Tiered Sponsorship**

Tiered sponsorship is used to associated a sponsor with an entire community rather than a single event. In it, sponsors are assigned to "tiers" (typically Gold, Silver, Bronze) and then are shown in the footer of the website in order of tier.

To use tiered sponsorship, you must first set up tiers by going to the ``Sponsorship Tiers`` page on the Admin panel and clicking ``New Sponsorship Tier``.

Then, visit a sponsor's page on the staff panel, and under ``Tiers`` click ``Add Tier``. Select the tier their sponsorship falls under and click ``Save``.
