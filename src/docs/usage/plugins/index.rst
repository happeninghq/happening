Plugins
=========

Happening is built on a sophisticated plugin architecture which allows you to enable and disable features of the software as needed. Happening ships with several useful plugins built in, and if functionality you need isn't provided it's easy to add your own.

To enable and disable plugins, log in as an administrator and click ``Admin`` on the menu, followed by ``Plugins`` on the sidebar. This will present you with a list of plugins which can be enabled and disabled by toggling the checkbox and pressing ``save``.
