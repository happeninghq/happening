Pages
======

Pages allow for the presentation of static content on your Happening website. This is particularly useful for About pages, Contact pages, and so on.

**Creating A Page**

To create a page, click the ``Pages`` button in the Staff panel, and then click ``New Page``.

The properties to be provided are:

* URL - Which is the unique relative URL of this page, the full URL will be http://yourwebsite.com/pages/URL - so if URL was "about" the full URL would be http://youwebsite.com/pages/about
* Title - This is used in the title bar of the website
* Path - Explained below
* Content - Markdown representing the content of the page.

**Paths**

Paths define where the page appears on the navigation bar. Levels are separated by forward slashes, and each level is a sub-menu. The final level of the path will be the link which leads to the page.

For example, the path About/Sponsorship will create an "About" menu at the first level, with a "Sponsorship" link showing when the "About" menu is opened. Adding another page with a path of About/Contact/Leadership will create a Contact sub-menu below the About menu, which contains within it a Leadership link.

**Editing A Page**

To edit a page, visit the ``Pages`` page of the Staff panel and click ``Edit`` alongside the page to be edited.

**Deleting A Page**

To delete a page, visit the ``Pages`` page of the Staff panel and click ``Delete`` alongside the page to be deleted.
