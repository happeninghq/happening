**Creating Events**

To create an event, go to the ``Events`` page of the Staff panel and click ``New Event``. Events must have a title, a date and time, and an initial number of tickets. Other properties are optional. Once the event has been configured press ``Save``.

**Presets**

If you are regularly creating events with similar properties, it might be worth creating a preset which allows you to load these properties in the future.

To create a preset, go to the ``Events`` page of the Staff panel and click on ``Presets``. Then click ``New Preset``. You will be presented with the same form used for creating an Event, with an additional ``Preset Name`` field. Give the preset a memorable name and enter the common properties. No properties are required when creating a preset. Once you are ready, press ``Save`` to create the preset. To edit or delete the preset use the buttons alongside the preset name on the Presets page.

After a preset has been created, when creating a new Event, a button ``Load Preset`` will appear at the top of the page. Click this and choose a preset to load the settings into the form.

**Editing Events**

To edit an event, go to the ``Events`` page of the Staff panel and click on the event title. Then click on ``Edit`` at the top of the page. Once you have changed the appropriate properties, click ``Save``.

**Viewing Events**

The most recent five events (including future events) are listed under the ``Events`` menu in the top navigation bar. Clicking on the event name will show the event page. Older events can be accessed by clicking on ``View All`` in this menu, and the next event is always shown on the index page.

The view event page shows a list of members who are attending the event, allows members to purchase :ref:`tickets`, and provides space for :ref:`plugins` to provide functionality.
