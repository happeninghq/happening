**Creating Events**

To create an event, go to the ``Events`` page of the Staff panel and click ``New Event``. Events must have a title, a date and time, and an initial number of tickets. Other properties are optional. Once the event has been configured press ``Save``.

**Editing Events**

To edit an event, go to the ``Events`` page of the Staff panel and click on the event title. Then click on ``Edit`` at the top of the page. Once you have changed the appropriate properties, click ``Save``.

**Viewing Events**

The most recent five events (including future events) are listed under the ``Events`` menu in the top navigation bar. Clicking on the event name will show the event page. Older events can be accessed by clicking on ``View All`` in this menu, and the next event is always shown on the index page.

The view event page shows a list of members who are attending the event, allows members to purchase :ref:`tickets`, and provides space for :ref:`plugins` to provide functionality.
