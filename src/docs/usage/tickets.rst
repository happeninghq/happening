=========

**Purchasing Tickets**

To purchase a ticket, go to the page of the Event (see :ref:`events`), select the number of tickets to purchase and click ``Purchase``.

**Viewing Purchased Tickets**

To view a list of purchased tickets, sign in and then click on your username on the top menu, then click on ``My Tickets``.

**Cancelling Tickets**

To cancel a ticket, view the list of purchased tickets (as above) and click ``Cancel`` next to the ticket you wish to cancel.

**Checking In Tickets**

To indicate that a ticket has been used and the member did attend the event, Happening supports the concept of "checking in" a ticket. To do this, visit the Event's page on the staff panel (see :ref:`events`), and click ``Manage Check Ins``.

This will present a list of purchased tickets with a search bar for filtering the tickets, and a ``Check In`` button for each ticket.
