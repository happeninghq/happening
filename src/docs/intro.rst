Introduction
==============

Happening is an open source event/community management tool.

Think Eventbrite meets Meetup, running on your own domain with your own branding.

The project is still in heavy development and still has traces of its past as the website of the `Southampton Code Dojo <https://www.southamptoncodedojo.com/>`_. It is not currently recommended for production use.

This documentation is also very incomplete, it will become more complete as the project progresses.
