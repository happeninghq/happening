                <h2>June 2014 Dojo</h2>
                <p>This month we decided to ban the use of Python incase we inadvertantly became the Southampton Python Dojo. Instead we voted on Facebook and decided that we'd use Javascript.</p>
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>This month's challenge was more open than usual - and involved implementing the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind</a>, for either one or two players. Everything else was left up to the participants.</p>
                <h2>Solutions</h2>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/sinjax/mastermind">Group 1</a> did not complete, having split up into too many subgroups, and was unable to bring the whole thing together in the end. Afterwards, one team member did successfully implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm">Donald Knuth's five guess algorithm</a> but this wasn't completed in time to be demoed on the night.</p>
                <p>All other groups managed to produce a version of Mastermind where the user can guess the code selected by the computer. Some groups used HTML tables for the UI, with CSS border-radius for the pegs, and at least one used canvas to draw the interface.</p>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/southampton-code-dojo/mastermind-june-2014-dojo">This group</a> created a version of the game using tables for layout with border-radius to represent pegs, where the player can click the pegs to make their guess.</p>
                <p>If any other groups have their code to submit, please <a href="mailto:jonathan@jscott.me">email me</a>.</p>
