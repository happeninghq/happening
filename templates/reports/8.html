                <h2>November 2014 Dojo</h2>

                <p>This month, Python was picked as the language to work with.</p>
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>We started out by attempting to run a pre-prepared challenge, however networking issues put an end to that and we voted on a replacement task - we decided to develop poetry generators.</p>
                <h2>Solutions</h2>

                </div>
                <p>This dojo was unique in that we had totally different solutions from each of the groups. Many generated Haikus but did so in different ways, and some generated entirely different forms of poetry. </p>
