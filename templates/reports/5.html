                <p>This month, Java was picked as the language to work with.</p>
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>This month's challenge was to implement a Countdown numbers round solver in Java. The idea was taken from <a href="http://rubyquiz.com/quiz7.html">Ruby Quiz 7</a> so you can go there for more details and to see some example answers where they had longer to work on them.</p>
