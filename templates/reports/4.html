                <p>We allowed Python in the vote again this month, and unsuprisingly it was selected again! We'll ensure it's not chosen again in the August dojo.</p>
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>This month's challenge was to implement a Roman Numerals calculator in Python. The challenge was open in that people could decide how it should work, how the user should interface with it, etc.</p>
