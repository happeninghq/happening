                <p>This month, Java was picked as the language to work with.</p>
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>This month's challenge was to implement a Minesweeper AI using Java. We had a pre-prepared engine and API that everyone could code to - so teams were only responsible for implementing the actual logic of choosing which space to click on next.</p>
                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="{% static "img/report7-result.jpg" %}">
                </div>
                <p>At the end of the dojo we played the entries against each other, starting on a small map(9*9, 10 mines), then medium (16*16, 40 mines), then large(22*22, 99 mines). Two teams failed in the first round, One in the second, and neither of our finalists were able to complete the final round.</p>
                <p>Everyone went for basically the same solution - which was to first check if any coordinates had a number which matched the number of surrounding spaces (in which case, flag them all) or had a number equal to the surrounding flags (in which case, click on the non-flagged spaces). After this, there was talk of trying to take into account patterns which were only visible when looking at multiple coordinates at once, or using some statistical methods to pick the best choice. Nobody really had time for that though so it was mostly random at this stage.</p>
