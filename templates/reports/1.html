                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>This month's challenge was to implement a Battleships AI in Python. These AIs played against each other using the <a href="https://github.com/southampton-code-dojo/battleships">Battleships competition</a> created for this dojo.</p>
                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="{% static "img/report1-result.jpg" %}">
                </div>
                <p>One group attempted a too complicated solution and didn't finish (though their solution probably would have won if it did). This left four AIs competing in the competition.</p>
                <p>The third placed solution was <a href="https://github.com/southampton-code-dojo/battleships/blob/southampton-code-dojo-1/team5.py">Team 5</a> which placed ships in specific places, and ensured that it didn't shoot at the same place twice.</p>
                <p>
                <p>In second place as <a href="https://github.com/southampton-code-dojo/battleships/blob/southampton-code-dojo-1/luckynumber.py">Luck Number</a> which had two different placements of ships, and attacked in multiple modes (attack_directed, attack_undirected, or search)</p>
                <p>The winner was <a href="https://github.com/southampton-code-dojo/battleships/blob/southampton-code-dojo-1/beetleships.py">Beetleships</a> which placed ships randomly except it favoured placing ships "against" the edge of the board, and shot in order from top-left to bottom-right until it hit something, then destroyed the ship before continuing.</p>
