    description:
        <p>We began as a small, passionate group of individuals who wanted to provide a distinctive and exceptional IT recruitment service. We'd seen agencies offering a division devoted to IT recruitment, but there was still a niche that we could fill. Combining our collective knowledge about the IT industry, the team has continued to grow and develop an extensive understanding of the local IT and IS sectors and their needs. The local focus of Spectrum IT gives us a unique advantage in finding those ideal and elusive roles in the area, and it also forms part of our company ethic. Although we work hard, we like to be able to work well with our clients and candidates and offer advice and guidance throughout (and after) the recruitment process.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a new position or looking to recruit please give us a call on 02380 765 800 or <a href="mailto:contactus@spectrumit.co.uk">contactus@spectrumit.co.uk</a>.</p>

    solution_text: <p>One group attempted a too complicated solution and didn't finish (though their solution probably would have won if it did). This left four AIs competing in the competition.</p>

    description: This code used a templating approach which disstilled a good Daily Mail headline down to "blame", "verbs", "values", and "threats". It linked these together with five possible templates (e.g. (blame) (verb) (value)) and then injected that headline into a page with the Daily Mail header.

    solution_text: <p>All groups except one managed to produce a version of Mastermind where the user can guess the code selected by the computer. Some groups used HTML tables for the UI, with CSS border-radius for the pegs, and at least one used canvas to draw the interface.</p>

    challenge_title: Minesweeper AI
    challenge_text: <p>This month's challenge was to implement a Minesweeper AI using Java. We had a pre-prepared engine and API that everyone could code to - so teams were only responsible for implementing the actual logic of choosing which space to click on next.</p>
    solution_text:
        <p>At the end of the dojo we played the entries against each other, starting on a small map(9*9, 10 mines), then medium (16*16, 40 mines), then large(22*22, 99 mines). Two teams failed in the first round, One in the second, and neither of our finalists were able to complete the final round.</p>
        <p>Everyone went for basically the same solution - which was to first check if any coordinates had a number which matched the number of surrounding spaces (in which case, flag them all) or had a number equal to the surrounding flags (in which case, click on the non-flagged spaces). After this, there was talk of trying to take into account patterns which were only visible when looking at multiple coordinates at once, or using some statistical methods to pick the best choice. Nobody really had time for that though so it was mostly random at this stage.</p>
